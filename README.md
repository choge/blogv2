# My Blog v2

I left the packages and so on for a while and totally messed them up by casually upgrading dependencies. It might be easier to build a new blog using the latest Next.js with app router and so on.

## Tech stack

- Next.js
- Vercel
  - Might move to CloudFront just to learn how to properly host Next.js there
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) to convert Markdown notes to React components
